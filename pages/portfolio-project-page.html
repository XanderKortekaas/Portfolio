        <h1>Building my professional portfolio</h1>
        <p>
          This page details the development of my portfolio website. <br>
          This project is started as a practical learing opportunity, so that i can learn Html and css. <br>

        <h2>
          The Process
        </h2>
        <p>
          Initially, my goal was to create a simple yet effective showcase of my skills and projects. <br> 
          This motivated me to rebuild my portfolio as a practical opportunity to learn HTML and CSS. <br> 
          The development process wasn't without its challenges, as is common with any project. <br> 
          I encountered an issue where the placement of elements wasn't behaving as expected. <br> 
          After a few days of debugging, I discovered that the site's maximum width was the constraint. <br>
          By doubling its original size, the layout issues were resolved.
        </p>
