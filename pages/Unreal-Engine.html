        <h1>Unreal Engine basics</h1>

        <h2>
          The Process
        </h2>
        <p>
            After I pointed my supervisor to some problems that were not possible to solve in Unity, 
            he pointed me to Unreal to try and give me the basic understanding of Unreal Engine.
            So I started to follow a beginner tutorial series of Bad Decisions Studios for Unreal Engine, 
            That covered almost everything that I needed to learn in Unreal. 
            Despite some small learning hurdles, which are normal while trying a new engine, I highly recommend their Tutorial Series    
        </p>
        <h2> Project overview</h2>

        <p>
          This Page showcases a Star Wars inspired scene I developed while learing Unreal Engine. 
          This project was a great way to dive deep into many of Unreal's core feature essential for enviromental design and real time visualization. 
          I also utilized Unreal's in-engine modeling tools for quick prototyping and level blocking, understanding their compared to dedicated 3D sofware like Blender or Maya.
          A notable advantage I learned about while using Unreal was Unreal's Instance system, which allows for allows for quick changes to materails and objects
          within a scene without alterig the original assets. Most of the assets used were sourced from the internet.  
        </p>
