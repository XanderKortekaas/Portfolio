          This page details things I have Learned while learning the basics of Unreal Engine.

        <h2>
          The Process
        </h2>
        <p>
            I began learning about body tracking because i was tasked with creating a project using it. My first attempt involved trying to integrate Touch Designer's body tracking into Unity via a plugin. 
            However, I couldn't locate the plugin settings within Touch Designer's menus, despite following the instructions in a relevant article. I then explored Unity's  native body tracking, only to find it was limited to IOS devices. 
            After sharing this limitation, my internship supervisor suggested I investigate Unreal Engine. I learned Unreals fundamentals through Bad Decisions Studio's Youtube tutorial series. This series effectively covered most of Unreal's features by guiding me though building a small scene; programming wasn't a focus, but that suited me as I prioritized understanding Unreal's core capabilities. 
            Desipite minor learnig hurdles, which are normal with a new engine, I highly recommend their tutorial series.
