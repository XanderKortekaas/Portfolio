        <h2>
          The Process
        </h2>
        <p>
          For the Night Racer project, we built a night-time racing game. We could make anything as long as it was a night race. This was to help us learn about using light in games. Our idea was a boat race in a flooded Netherlands.
          I mostly worked on making the boat move. Since I didn't know how to make a boat in Unity, I figured out how to make it move like a hovercraft.
          I also helped fix problems with our project on Github. Another developer had issues with Github but didn't tell us, because he was using OneDrive. This caused problems for the team. That developer also wasn't clear about his work. For example, he often didn't know what he'd be doing next. When we first had a problem with Github and found out it was him, we were surprised and then worked to fix it.
          Even though it was hard to work together sometimes, I focused on making the boat move well and fixing the technical issues.

        <h2>Key learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Being more strict to your Co dev if he is doing other things</li>
          <li>Fixing some problems in github</li>
          <li>That making boat movement is not popular</li>
